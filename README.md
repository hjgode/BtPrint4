BtPrint4
========

my first android steps

btprint4 is a small demo tool to print to Intermec portable Bluetooth printers. It comes with some demo files in different printer languages, like ESC/P, FingerPrint and IPL.

First you have to either type, scan (barcode) or discover the right BT printer device.

After you have defined the BT printer (using the BT MAC address), you can connect to the printer.

When the printer is connected you can browse the provided demo print files and for example select an ESC/P, 2 inch receipt print demo.

Finally you print the demo file on the Intermc Bluetooth printer.
